# ProbRegEx
Probabilistic regular expressions as an embedded DSL for F#.

The DSL is implemented as a single F# program.
The file Program.fs has its own main function with tests, so simply compile and run this file to test the program.
An F#-compiler must be installed on your system (obviously).

This project was originally a submission to an assignment in the course "Programming Language Design", as part of my Bachelor in Computer Science.
